# PracticePanther Data Migration - Take Home Assessment

This repository contains my solution to the data migration assessment for PracticePanther.

## Deliverables

- `transform_contacts.py`: Python script for transforming the contact data per the instructions.
- `transformed_contacts.csv`: Output file with all specified changes.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have `pandas` installed.
2. Place the original contacts CSV in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python transform_contacts.py
    ```
4. The transformed CSV will be generated as `transformed_contacts.csv`.

*Alternatively, see the included Jupyter/Colab notebook for step-by-step execution.*
